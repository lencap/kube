# vm.conf
# Running 'vm prov' in a directory with this file in it will automatically
# provision the VMs defined here. Each VM requires its own section name,
# which becomes the VM name. Then there are 6 other possible keys you can
# define. Two of which are mandatory (image and netip). The other 4 (cpus,
# memory, vmcopy, and vmrun) are optional. Lines starting with a hash(#)
# are treated as comments. Spaces can only be used within double quotes (").
# vmcopy and vmrun are perfect for copying/running bootstrapping scripts.
# Note that duplicate keys aren't allowed, for now, so it's best to put
# everything inside the bootstrapping script.
